2. Write a description of what you thought about when you were designing the code. 
What did *you* think was important to do to make it easy to test the program. 
What are some of the challenges that you faced when testing this assignment.

When designing the code, I was trying to think of every possible way the program could throw
an error or return unexpected results. These included things like returning incorrect information
or returning information for a user that did not exist. Another situation I considered was the
case where someone is a valid user on GitHub but happens to have no repos, but since I did not know
where I could find an example of an account like that, I had to omit it as a test case. Regardless,
when I was implementing my program, I made sure to check whether the data being pulled actually
contained content, and if not, GitHub would return a status code. I made it easy to test for certain
situations like if there are no repositories or no commits by returning error messages for the specific
conditions. In general, there is more that can be done to improve the test cases, but examples of users
that might match the errors would be necessary to do so.
